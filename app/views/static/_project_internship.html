  <p>In 2013, Youth Advocacy Network started an internship program for students who excelled in the class and were commited to their further education. Last year, 10 students were given internships with non-profits that operate in Buea.Internships give our students invaluable experience; they allow our students to take advantage of not only helping a local NGO in their community, but also gaining knowledge and hands on experience about how non-profit organizations work. This year we are hoping to place a minimum of 8 student interns at different NGOs in Buea.</p>
